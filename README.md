## Description

Welcome to my React Native To-Do List app! This project serves as my introduction to the world of mobile app development using React Native. The app provides a simple yet effective way to manage your tasks, focusing on the core aspects of React Native development and utilizing CSS-in-JS for styling.

- State management using `useState`
- CSS-in-JS for styling (e.g., `styled-components`)
